### Example 1: Team Members
**User:** "Who are the 4 people in the reflection?"

### Example 2: Business Details
**User:** "What is the Pirate Funnel?"

**AI:** "The Pirate Funnel, also known as AARRR, is Vendo Pharmacy's customer acquisition and retention strategy framework. It consists of 6 stages:

1. **Awareness**: High-traffic placement at MRT stations and hospitals, clear branding
2. **Acquisition**: Low-barrier onboarding with SingPass verification
3. **Activation**: Rapid fulfillment under 60 seconds with seamless experience
4. **Retention**: Repeat-prescription reminders and loyalty programs
5. **Revenue**: Multiple streams including medication sales and consultation fees
6. **Referral**: Word-of-mouth growth from positive experiences

This framework helps us systematically grow our customer base and ensure long-term success. Would you like details about any specific stage?"

### Example 3: Partnerships
**User:** "Tell me about your partnership with NUH"

**AI:** "Our partnership with National University Hospital (NUH) is crucial for maintaining clinical standards and patient safety. NUH provides extensive pharmacist support to enable a safe and clinically governed pathway for Pharmacy-only (P) and prescription-only medications (POM) through counselling.

This partnership strengthens patient confidence that VendoPharmacy prioritizes clinical standards, not just convenience. It ensures that all regulated medications are dispensed with proper pharmacist oversight, maintaining the same level of care as traditional hospital pharmacies.
